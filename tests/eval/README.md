# Eval harness

Runs the Matchline extraction/matching/generation pipeline against a
fixture corpus and reports accuracy, latency, and cost. Exists to
enforce the 80/80 quality bar in `specs/matchline.md § Success
metrics`.

## Usage

```bash
# Stub mode — fixtures listed, no LLM calls. Runs without API keys.
npm run eval

# Real-scoring mode — calls Anthropic + OpenAI against every (resume, JD) pair.
# Smoke mode = first resume × first JD; full mode = cross product.
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$(op read 'op://Private/<anthropic-item>/credential')
export OPENAI_API_KEY=$(op read 'op://Private/<openai-item>/credential')
npm run eval                # smoke
npm run eval -- --full      # full corpus — projection-guard gated
```

`--full` is opt-in because a daily full run of the 10×10 corpus at
the PRD's target $0.75/flow is ~$270/month — 5.4× the combined LLM
cap. The projection guard short-circuits `--full` runs that would
exceed any per-provider monthly cap (see `tests/eval/projection.ts`,
defaults from `memory/matchline_budget_ceilings.md`).

### API keys

Both `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are required for real
scoring. Without them the harness falls back to listing fixtures
without scoring (clear "set API keys" note in each fixture's
output). The `*ForCli()` factories in `functions/src/llm/{anthropic,openai}.ts`
read the env vars directly, bypassing `defineSecret` (which only
resolves inside the Cloud Functions runtime).

CI runs the harness in stub mode (no keys) — gating on real
accuracy lands in [#137](https://github.com/nathanjohnpayne/matchline/issues/137)
once the corpus is large enough for stable percentiles.

## Layout

```
tests/eval/
├── run.ts             CLI entry point
├── runForFixture.ts   per-fixture orchestration (#136)
├── loadFixtures.ts    typed fixture-file readers (#136)
├── mapping.ts         runtime UUID → labeler mnemonic (#136)
├── scoring.ts         pure: jaccard, unit-set accuracy, top-K overlap
├── projection.ts      pure: monthly-spend cap check
├── report.ts          pure: stdout formatter
└── *.test.ts          vitest unit tests
```

All pipeline work (extraction, matching, generation, validation)
runs through the same `functions/src/llm/` wrappers as production,
so cost tracking and model config flow through unchanged.

## Fixture layout

```
tests/fixtures/
├── resumes/             raw resume text, one file per fixture
├── jds/                 raw JD text, one file per fixture
├── expected-units/      hand-labeled ExperienceUnit[] per resume
├── expected-matches/    hand-labeled top-K match IDs per (resume, jd)
└── expected-asset-traces/   per-generated-output claim → Unit map
```

Phase 0 ships the directory skeleton only; the 10×10 corpus is
populated in [#25](https://github.com/nathanjohnpayne/matchline/issues/25)
(Phase 1).

## Current status

- **Phase 0** (#48): harness runnable on an empty / single-fixture set; pure scoring & projection helpers ship with tests; no live extraction yet. ✅ shipped.
- **Phase 1 / #25 sub-issue 1/3** (#135): first hand-curated fixture pair (Nathan + Google JD) + adversarial-fab pin. ✅ shipped at `27aeb36`.
- **Phase 1 / #25 sub-issue 2/3** (#136): wire real `extraction` + `jdParsing` + `matching` calls into `run.ts`; CLI key plumbing; runtime-UUID → mnemonic mapping. **THIS PR.**
- **Phase 1 / #25 sub-issue 3/3** (#137): populate the 10×10 corpus; flip the 80/80 CI gate to blocking; needs more user input for prospect-list JDs.
- **Phase 3** (#41): replace the mocked `currentUsage` in the projection guard with a live `llm_calls` Firestore aggregation.

```
runForFixture(input, deps)
  ├─ loadResumeText             reads tests/fixtures/resumes/<id>.txt
  ├─ loadJdText                 reads tests/fixtures/jds/<id>.txt

  ├─ mapUnitIds                 runtime UUID → labeler mnemonic (token Jaccard, 0.30 threshold)
  ├─ mapRequirementIds          same shape for Reqs
  ├─ unitSetAccuracy            extraction score vs. expected_units
  ├─ compositeIdsFromMatches    "<unit_mnemonic>:<req_mnemonic>" strings
  └─ topKOverlap                match score vs. expected_top_matches
```

Generation + validation scoring isn't wired in this PR; those layers
need Firestore for AssetRef persist and aren't end-to-end purely
in-memory. Future enhancement.

## Exit codes

- `0` — clean (empty fixtures OR all gates passed).
- `1` — one of the 80/80 gates regressed (Phase 1+).
- `2` — harness itself crashed (uncaught exception).
